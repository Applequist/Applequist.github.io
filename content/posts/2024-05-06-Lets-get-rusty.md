Rust is system programming language that empowers anyone to write correct, safe and fast programs.

## Rust rocks!

Here is the classic hello world:

1. Create a binary package:

```bash
$ cargo new hello --bin
```

2. Edit the `hello/src/main.rs` file to look like this:

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello World!");
}
```

3. And compile and run the program with:

```bash
$ cargo run hello
```

Et voila!
