## About

Hi, I am Brieuc Desoutter. I was born and raised in France. I studied computer science and started my career there.

In 2008, I moved to Brussels, Belgium, where I met my wife in 2013. We got married in 2015.

Two kids later, we needed a change and in 2020, we moved to Saudi Arabia where I currently live.
We have a good life there but I really miss the trees from Belgium and the Alps... And a job! 
I hope to relocate back to France soon...
